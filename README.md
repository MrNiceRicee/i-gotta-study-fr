# i-gotta-study-fr

## Description
This is a project to help me keep track and organize my studies. It'll be directed at DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and other topics that I find interesting. I've already made other DSA repos, but I want to keep this one more organized and focused than the others.

## Notes
I'll be taking notes on Excalidraw, if you want to follow along this is the link
